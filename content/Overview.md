## Absinthe release version 2.0 annotations and important feature/changelog statements.

The-M-Project 1.x as we call it was from our point of view pretty good, but has here and there little tweaks. We could have fix some bugs and work with the existing one. In this process we questioned everything and after huge discussions we decided to take what's good and remove everything we don't like. Furthermore we added everything what we think a mobile HTML5/JavaScript framework needs. The following list gives you an overview of changes

- The-M-Project is based on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
- [Bikini](bikini.html) - a implementation of Model/Server connectivity to write realtime, collaborative apps
- Espresso (command line tool) is now based on [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
- No jQuery mobile support at the moment
- Different Themes out of the Box (Default, Android, iOS7)
- URL navigation and deep linking
